# sql-challenge
Module 9 challenge

For this challenge, I imported all of the CSV files in the Resources folder into PgAdmin and made each one into a table (see SQL-Challenge_Data_Engineering.sql for code). Then I used all of the tables to create the following lists(see SQL-Challenge-Data_Analysis.sql for code). The screenshots are of the first several lines in the PgAdmin output:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
